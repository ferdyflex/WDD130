          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>Whitewater rafting can be traced back to 1811 when the first recorded attempt to navigate the Snake River in Wyoming was planned. With no training, experience, or proper equipment, the river was found to be too difficult and dangerous. Hence, it was given the nickname "Mad River".We strive to give our customers a wonderful and a happy experience.To make customers always remember the purpose of Whitewater rafting.</p>
